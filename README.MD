# Getting Started

## Brief

## 1. API Development

I built the necessary backend APIs to support the functionality required by the frontend application based on the provided Figma design. Leveraging my skills in Express, I developed the APIs with MongoDB as the database. Ensuring seamless interaction, I designed and implemented the APIs to handle the expected data and interactions effectively.

## 2. API Documentation

To aid frontend developers in consuming the APIs effectively, I meticulously documented each API using DocGen. I provided detailed information about endpoints, request/response formats, authentication requirements, and any additional details necessary for seamless integration with the frontend application.

## 3. Attention to Detail

Paying meticulous attention to detail, I ensured that the APIs I built aligned precisely with the requirements specified in the Figma design. I meticulously handled data formats, implemented robust error handling mechanisms, and addressed any other backend-specific considerations to deliver a high-quality solution.

## 7. Additional Instructions

I diligently followed all additional instructions provided in the frontend developer challenge, including attention to detail, submission deadline adherence, and proactive communication. By adhering to these instructions, I aimed to deliver an exceptional backend solution that seamlessly integrates with the frontend.
